# SpaceMan

Hangman! I mean Spaceman, is a game where you guess letters to see if you get the word right, or get a pretty picture by 
losing. This is a terminal based program and I hope you can have some fun with it. (it is pretty challenging)
### to run use $ python3 spaceman.py 
This takes words from a written file, and randomly chooses one, then asks the user to guess the word. Be warned tho, if you
miss too many letters you might get a spaceman on your hands!
